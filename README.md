# Final Project "Personality Test"

**Project Description**:
The Personality Test project is a Python program designed to determine a user's personality type based on their preferences in movies, music, books, and daily habits. The program interacts with the user through a series of questions and assigns points to generate a personality profile. Additionally, it manages recommendation data using CSV files to enhance the user experience.

**How to Run the Program**:
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Download all project files, including 'Final Project.py' and 'recommendations.csv' (if available).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
4. Run the program using the command:
   python Final Project.py
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to answer the questions and discover your personality type.

**Currently Implemented Features**:
Interactive personality test based on multiple-choice questions.
Automatic management of CSV files to store or retrieve recommendation data.
Dynamic creation of project folders if they do not exist.
Simple and engaging user interface using text-based interaction.
Scoring system to evaluate and categorize personality types.

**Reflection on Early Impact or Benefit**:
This project helps people learn more about themselves by thinking about their likes, dislikes, and behaviors. It also helped me get better at programming, especially with stuff like handling files, getting user input, and using control structures. In the future, I’d like to make the Personality Test cooler by adding a simple graphic interface or giving personalized recommendations based on the user’s answers.
